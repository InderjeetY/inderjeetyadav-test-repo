                    <ul>
                        <li>Spearheaded a strategic experiment to optimize user support journeys by directing customers to a chat bot before connecting to a live agent, resulting in an annual run rate of 26K regretted case reduction (25% of my team's RCR goal).</li>
                        <li>Architected and delivered the MVP for the 'Known Issues' service to proactively surface existing user issues by aggregating data from multiple backend services. Subsequently spearheaded the 'Fast Follow' re-architecture to refactor the system into a scalable, standalone microservice, correcting flawed issue prioritization logic and reducing technical debt.</li>
                        <li>Integrated and optimized Genie, a rule-based troubleshooting tool, for Google Ads support. Led the technical integration into the Ads Get Help page, reducing case creation, and drove the development of a proof of concept for leadership. Collaborated with UX and data analysts, resulting in a 2% increase in user engagement and a 4.5% annual reduction in case creation. </li>
                        <li>Migrated the Escalation module (for connecting with live agents in the GSE AI chat bot) to follow the Conversational AI Standard and Practices (CSP). This allowed migration to streaming RPC and made the module independent for integration by other services like Ads Help Guide.</li>
                        <li>Designed, ran, and analyzed an SEO Experiment to update Google's YouTube help center article metadata using Gemini Pro, resulting in a +2% increase in page rank, +3% (approx. +510k) search impressions, and +4% (approx. +6000) clicks per day. Wrote a project document to automate this process for all Google help centers.</li>
                        <li>Led the project to migrate the Escalation module from a hardcoded design to a configurable one, allowing onboarding of multiple Google help centers. Onboarded 5 new help centers within 5 weeks, enabling >65k users to be connected with a live agent per month.</li>
                    </ul>
